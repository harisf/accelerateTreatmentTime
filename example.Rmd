```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(accelerateTreatmentTime)
```


## Simulate data
```{r}
n <- 1000
simulateData(n)
```

The simulated data consists of individuals waiting for treatment. We follow each individual from diagnosis until death or censoring. There is a binary baseline covariate $X$, where $X=0$ denotes healthier individuals, while $X=1$ denotes individuals that are worse off. There is also a binary time-varying covariate $L$ which changes from $L=0$ to $L=1$ for an individual who has progressed further in his disease. Healthier individuals (as expressed by both $X$ and $L$) are more likely to receive treatment. The treatment itself has a protecting effect against death.
